**When in doubt, ask:**
1. Does this make our community feel seen and supported?
2. Would someone with ADHD feel welcome here?
3. Is this something Gen Z would genuinely share?
4. Does this sound like a supportive friend?
5. Are we celebrating progress over perfection?

**If any answer is "no," it's time to revisit the brand guidelines!**
