# Focus Flock: Retention & Community Engagement Framework
## Building Sticky Habits Through Social Connection and ADHD-Friendly Design

---

## Executive Summary

Focus Flock's retention strategy leverages the power of community accountability, ADHD-optimized engagement patterns, and progressive value delivery to create lasting user habits. Our approach recognizes that traditional productivity apps fail neurodivergent users by creating shame cycles - instead, we build dopamine-positive feedback loops that celebrate progress and connection.

**Core Retention Philosophy:**
- Community connection prevents isolation-driven churn
- ADHD-friendly design reduces overwhelm and shame
- Progressive value unlocking maintains engagement
- Creator content provides fresh motivation
- Social accountability drives habit formation

**Key Metrics:**
- Target 30-day retention: 75%
- Target 90-day retention: 60%
- Target annual retention: 85% (paid users)
- Target NPS: 70+ (ADHD-friendly satisfaction)
